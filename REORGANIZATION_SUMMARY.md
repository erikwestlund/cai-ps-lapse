# Analysis Pipeline Reorganization Summary

## Date: 2025-09-08

### What Was Done

1. **Renamed reanalysis-9-alternative_specifications.qmd → reanalysis-9-outcome_models.qmd**
   - File now focuses solely on fitting outcome models for each PS method
   - Removed pooling logic to separate file

2. **Created reanalysis-10-pooling_results.qmd**
   - New dedicated file for pooling results across imputations
   - Implements Rubin's rules for proper multiple imputation pooling
   - Includes logging throughout the process
   - Saves individual pooled results after each method
   - Creates forest plots and summary tables

3. **Added pool_single_method function to alt_specs.R**
   - Lines 750-807: Implements Rubin's rules for pooling
   - Properly handles between and within imputation variance
   - Returns OR with confidence intervals and p-values

4. **Helper functions already in alt_specs.R**
   - format_for_forest_plot() - Formats data for visualization
   - create_summary_table() - Creates publication-ready tables
   - print_method_comparison() - Compares methods to reference

### File Structure

```
reanalysis_results/data/
├── ps_cache/                 # PS method results (method_imp{#}.rds)
├── outcome_cache/            # Outcome models (outcome_method_imp{#}.rds)
└── ps_cache/pooled_results/  # Pooled results (pooled_method.rds)
```

### Running the Analysis

1. Run reanalysis-9-outcome_models.qmd to fit outcome models
2. Run reanalysis-10-pooling_results.qmd to pool results

### Key Improvements

- Separated concerns: outcome fitting vs pooling
- Added resilient caching with intermediate saves
- Proper logging throughout the process
- Reduced file sizes by not saving full model objects
- Crash-resilient design with ability to resume
